TuitionSync is a **desktop app for private tutors managing tutees' contacts and tuition/personal scheduling, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TuitionSync can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
Note that all contacts added to TuitionSync will automatically be taken as a tutee, regardless of whether it is tagged as tutee.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all tutees.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 d/sunday s/16:00-18:00 b/98226544` : Adds a tutee named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all tutees and activities.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will cause an error.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will result in an error message.

* All commands are case-sensitive. e.g. if the command specifies `Help`, it will cause an error as the `help` command should be lowercase.
* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### More on Get Commands
This section describes in more detail the expected behaviour of the `get` commands.

When using these commands, the `NAME` parameters acts as partial matches for full names.
We illustrate using `getaddress` as an example:

When the AB3 has only one user called `John Doe`, applying `getaddress John Doe` will return John's email.

![result for 'getaddress John Doe'](images/getAddressJohnDoeResult.png)

When the AB3 has two users, one called `John` and one called `John Doe`, applying `getaddress John` will return
both `John` and `John Doe` person card and return the multiple entries error.

![result for 'getaddress John'](images/getAddressMultipleJohnResult.png)

When the AB3 has two users, one called `John` and one called `John Doe`, applying `getaddress John D` will return
`John Doe`'s email.

![result for 'getaddress John D'](images/getAddressJohnDResult.png)

## Schedule-specific commands 

### Listing schedule : `schedule`

Shows a list of your current schedule

![result for 'schedule'](images/schedule.png)

Format: `schedule`

### Add activity : `addactivity`

Adds an activity to your schedule.

Format: `addactivity i/ACTIVITY_INFO d/DAY s/TIMESLOT`

* Activity info can be no longer than 100 characters.
* The format for the timeslot strictly follow `HH:MM-HH:MM`, it cannot extend past midnight and `00:00` is taken to be midnight of the day stated.
* Timeslot cannot have the starting time be earlier or the same as the end time.
* Acitivty to be added cannot clash with existing activites.
* Day input must be the full name of the day, case-insensitive.

Examples:
* `addactivity i/lesson d/friday s/09:00-10:00`

### Delete activity : `deleteactivity`

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>

Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
